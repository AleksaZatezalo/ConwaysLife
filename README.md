# Conway's Game of Life Coded in C++
Conway's game of life, simply known as Life is a cellular automation game simply known as Life. It was designed by Mathematition John Horton Conway in 1970 and is a Zero Player Game, meaning it's outcome is dependent on it's inital state. It has 4 basic rules which are as follows: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## The Glider
The glider with is defined by five cells located at (x, y), (x+1, y), (x+2, y), (x+2, y+1) and (x+1, y+2) is emblematic of the hacker community. It glides across the screen diagonaly and can colide with other gliders to produce more complex patterns. If gliders colide correctly they can be used to great And, Or, and Not Gates creating for a Turing Complete Computer with theoretically infinate memory and computing power. Because of this it is considered emblamatic of the hacker community. 

## This Version
This version of Life is coded in C++. It randomly populates the board with living cells and allows you to watch the development of the board in real time. This version was created with the intent of being as memory efficient as possible.

# Conway's Game of Life Coded in C++
Conway's game of life, simply known as Life is a cellular automation game simply known as Life. It was designed by Mathematition John Horton Conway in 1970 and is a Zero Player Game, meaning it's outcome is dependent on it's inital state. It has 4 basic rules which are as follows:
    1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
    2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
    4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
